## Reflective Practice

The amateur is willing to try anything, then share the results of what they learnt. Amateurs might lack formal training, but they’re all lifelong learners and they make a point of learning in the open so that others can then learn from their failures and successes.

As writers I think we can all learn a lot from Doogie Howser, M.D. For those of you who didn’t grow up in the pre-internet age, it was a show about a teenage genius who became a medical doctor, and every show wrapped up with Doogie writing a couple of lines on his word processor that perfectly reflected the theme of that day.
I remember once when I was fifteen, around the same age as Doogie, my dad turned to me and said, “William if you want to be a writer, one of the best things you can do is what Doogie Howser does. Write a couple of lines of personal reflection at the end of each day.”

Reflective practice is the ability to reflect on one's actions so as to engage in a process of continuous learning.[1] According to one definition it involves "paying critical attention to the practical values and theories which inform everyday actions, by examining practice reflectively and reflexively. This leads to developmental insight".[2] A key rationale for reflective practice is that experience alone does not necessarily lead to learning; deliberate reflection on experience is essential.

Reflective practice can be an important tool in practice-based professional learning settings where people learn from their own professional experiences, rather than from formal learning or knowledge transfer. It may be the most important source of personal professional development and improvement. It is also an important way to bring together theory and practice; through reflection a person is able to see and label forms of thought and theory within the context of his or her work.[5] A person who reflects throughout his or her practice is not just looking back on past actions and events, but is taking a conscious look at emotions, experiences, actions, and responses, and using that information to add to his or her existing knowledge base and reach a higher level of understanding.

Donald Schön's 1983 book The Reflective Practitioner introduced concepts such as reflection-on-action and reflection-in-action which explain how professionals meet the challenges of their work with a kind of improvisation that is improved through practice.

Central to the development of reflective theory was interest in the integration of theory and practice, the cyclic pattern of experience and the conscious application of lessons learned from experience. Since the 1970s, there has been a growing literature and focus around experiential learning and the development and application of reflective practice.

The emergence in more recent years of blogging has been seen as another form of reflection on experience in a technological age.

I have long admired the work of Teehan+Lax. Every time they write a case study, I pore over their process, thinking, and execution. They’ve done some outstanding work, including being an early design partner for Medium.

What follows reads like one of the Teehan+Lax case studies I’ve learned to love. 

Reflective practice provides a development opportunity for those in leadership positions. Managing a team of people requires a delicate balance between people skills and technical expertise, and success in this type of role does not come easily. Reflective practice provides leaders with an opportunity to critically review what has been successful in the past and where improvement can be made.

Reflective learning organizations have invested in coaching programs for their emerging and established leaders.[68] Leaders frequently engage in self-limiting behaviours because of their over-reliance on their preferred ways of reacting and responding.[69] Coaching can help support the establishment of new behaviours, as it encourages reflection, critical thinking and transformative learning. Adults have acquired a body of experience throughout their life, as well as habits of mind that define their world.[70] Coaching programs support the process of questioning and potentially rebuilding these pre-determined habits of mind. The goal is for leaders to maximize their professional potential, and in order to do this, there must be a process of critical reflection on current assumptions.[71]

Reflective practice can help any individual to develop personally, and is useful for professions other than those discussed above. It allows professionals to continually update their skills and knowledge and consider new ways to interact with their colleagues. David Somerville and June Keeling suggested eight simple ways that professionals can practice more reflectively:[72]

Seek feedback: Ask "Can you give me some feedback on what I did?"
Ask yourself "What have I learnt today?" and ask others "What have you learnt today?"
Value personal strengths: Identify positive accomplishments and areas for growth
View experiences objectively: Imagine the situation is on stage and you are in the audience
Empathize: Say out loud what you imagine the other person is experiencing
Keep a journal: Record your thoughts, feelings and future plans; look for emerging patterns
Plan for the future: Plan changes in behavior based on the patterns you identified
Create your own future: Combine the virtues of the dreamer, the realist, and the critic
