<p>The amateur is willing to try anything, then share the results of what they learnt. Amateurs might lack formal training, but they‚Äôre all lifelong learners and they make a point of learning in the open so that others can then learn from their failures and successes.</p>

<p>As writers I think we can all learn a lot from Doogie Howser, M.D. For those of you who didn‚Äôt grow up in the pre-internet age, it was a show about a teenage genius who became a medical doctor, and every show wrapped up with Doogie writing a couple of lines on his word processor that perfectly reflected the theme of that day.
I remember once when I was fifteen, around the same age as Doogie, my dad turned to me and said, ‚ÄúWilliam if you want to be a writer, one of the best things you can do is what Doogie Howser does. Write a couple of lines of personal reflection at the end of each day.‚Äù</p>

<p>Reflective practice is the ability to reflect on one‚Äôs actions so as to engage in a process of continuous learning.[1] According to one definition it involves ‚Äúpaying critical attention to the practical values and theories which inform everyday actions, by examining practice reflectively and reflexively. This leads to developmental insight‚Äù.[2] A key rationale for reflective practice is that experience alone does not necessarily lead to learning; deliberate reflection on experience is essential.</p>

<p>I have long admired the work of Teehan+Lax. Every time they write a case study, I pore over their process, thinking, and execution. They‚Äôve done some outstanding work, including being an early design partner for Medium.</p>

<p>What follows reads like one of the Teehan+Lax case studies I‚Äôve learned to love.</p>
