<p>The amateur is willing to try anything, then share the results of what they learnt. Amateurs might lack formal training, but they‚Äôre all lifelong learners and they make a point of learning in the open so that others can then learn from their failures and successes.</p>

<p>As writers I think we can all learn a lot from Doogie Howser, M.D. For those of you who didn‚Äôt grow up in the pre-internet age, it was a show about a teenage genius who became a medical doctor, and every show wrapped up with Doogie writing a couple of lines on his word processor that perfectly reflected the theme of that day.
I remember once when I was fifteen, around the same age as Doogie, my dad turned to me and said, ‚ÄúWilliam if you want to be a writer, one of the best things you can do is what Doogie Howser does. Write a couple of lines of personal reflection at the end of each day.‚Äù</p>
